    "The system uses a Multi-Modal CNN with Genetic Optimization (MMCNN-GO). It extracts spatial features from RGB images via CNN, reduces spectral (e.g., NIR) dimensionality with PCA, fuses both into a single feature vector, and classifies quality/defects via fully-connected layers with Softmax. A Genetic Algorithm tunes hyperparameters to maximize accuracy and reduce false positives. On Apple tests, MMCNN-GO achieved 98.5% accuracy, 97.8% precision, and a 1.2% false positive rate, outperforming baselines like vanilla CNN, SVM, RF, VGG-16, and Inception variants."
